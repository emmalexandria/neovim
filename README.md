# Neovim Configuration
This is my custom Neovim configuration, built after using LazyVim for a few months. It shares a lot of keybindings with LazyVim, 
but is more lightweight. 

It was built to have better control of my editor and to gain some understanding of Neovim with the hope of eventually getting into plugin development.

## Plugin List
I'm not including the obvious here, like Mason, Treesitter and lspconfig.
- `blink.cmp`
- `conform.nvim`
- `telescope.nvim`
- `neo-tree.nvim`
- `vimtex`
- `lualine.nvim`
- `noice.nvim`
- `smear-cursor.nvim`
- `which-key.nvim`
- `tiny-code-action.nvim`
- `trouble.nvim`
- `snacks.nvim`
- `catppuccin`

## Unresolved Issues
`noice.nvim` seems to struggle to render markdown in certain cases, not sure why.
